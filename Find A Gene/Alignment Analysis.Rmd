```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load Bio3D library

```{r}
library(bio3d)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

Read in sequence alignment file

```{r}
alignment <- read.fasta("Find a Gene Project/Black Bear/AlignmentFile_fasta")
```

Calculate sequence identity matrix

```{r}
identities <- seqidentity(alignment)
```

Generate a heatmap

```{r}
heatmap(identities, margins = c(10, 1))
```

Create a consensus sequence

```{r}
consensus_seq <- consensus(alignment)
new_sequence <- consensus_seq$seq
```

```{r}
blast_res <- blast.pdb(consensus_seq$seq)

```

```{r}
final_consensus <- glue::collapse(new_sequence)
final_consensus
```
